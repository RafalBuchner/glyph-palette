# glyph-palette
Tool made for exploring relationships between the components and glyphs.

## how it works
it will create an additional menu in the right click dialog. 
- Display the palette by checking "show related cluster".
  Teleport to related glyph by double clicking on it.
- Display cloud of related glyphs in behind by checking "show related in back"
- print out names of related glyphs by clicking on "print out cluster"
- open cluster in SpaceCenter - I think it is clear, what it does
- "select palette in font" will select related glyphs in the font window
